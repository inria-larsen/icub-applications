# The speech during the red ball demo is divided into three states:
#  - [speech_reach] -> it is used when the robot "sees" the ball,
#                      and is trying to reach it
#  - [speech_grasp] -> is performed after the grasping action
#                      (regardless of its success/failure)
#  - [speech_idle] -> is used after the red ball is pulled away
#                     from the robot's sight
# For each of these states, there is a group (listed below).
# Each line is a sentence that will be spoken by the robot
# according to its state. Add as many sentences (i.e. lines)
# as you'd like to these groups: they will be chosen randomly
# by the manager at runtime.

[speech_reach]
"Oh.! There it is!!"
"Stay still, otherwise I can't see it!"
"Bring it closer to my eyes please!"

[speech_grasp]
"Thank you dear"
"Did I take it?"
"I like playing with the red ball!"
"Yippi ka yeah!"

[speech_idle]
"Oh no! I liked this ball!"
"Oh my Gosh!! Where's the red ball??"
"Oh no! Where did you put the ball??"
